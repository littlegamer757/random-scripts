# Random Script Collection

Some random bash scripts I created to make my life easier and get some experience in writing for bash. Use at your own risk, if you think they could be useful to you. Did my best to write some documentation on them, but with a bit of looking at the code anybody should be able to understand what is happening fairly quickly. dankeebenfoiswiedaschaun
